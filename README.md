# decimal-fraction-approximator

This program finds the simplest fraction that is closest to a decimal.

Accuracy and running time are specified with "accuracy_score", the minimum fractional error
between the input and the output fraction.

Sample outputs:

Desired accuracy: 0.1 * 100%
End value: 3.2
End accuracy: 0.9817477042468103
Approximation of 3.141592653589793: 3 + 1/5, or 16/5.
